Inline element:
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

Example
<span>Hello World</span>
Here are the inline elements in HTML:

<a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!


Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>

The <span> Element:::

The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:


<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
